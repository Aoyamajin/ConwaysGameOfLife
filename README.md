# Conways Game Of Life
John's quick Conways Game Of Life implementation.

### Devloped Using: 
    * Eclipse IDE
    * Java 7
  
### How To run this:
    1. (Optional)Update the "conways_game_of_life.properties" file with you preferred settings.
    2. Run the main method in the ConwaysGameOfLife.java class.
    3. The results of Conway's little game will appear in a text file located in a "results" folder within the project's directory.  The name of the file has a timestamp appended to it, so each run will create a new file.
